	<h2>What Is This?</h2>
	<p id="about-font">
		"The Female Football Fanatic" is a podcast site that focuses on football while giving voice to an underrepresented segment of the fan population--women. Though I do talk a little basketball from time to time, the main topic of conversation revolves around the best sport on the planet--college football--with a side of NFL talk. 
	</p>

	<h2>Who Is This?</h2>
	<p id="about-font">
		"The Female Football Fanatic" was invented and created by Ren Simon, the voice behind the podcasts. Ren considers herself a "Southern traitor" as a born-and-raised Southerner who is a Big Ten fan and a Michigan alum. Previously a sportswriter for various sites and blogs such as Bleacher Report, Diehard College Football Fans, WolverinesMix.com, etc, Ren is working on building this project from the ground up.

	<h2>Open Volunteer Positions</h2>
	<p id="about-font">
		"The Female Football Fanatic" would love to have guests on her podcasts, as well as co-hosts. As giving voice to female sports fans is one of the site's goals, I'd love to have an interested, knowledgeable and passionate woman co-host or guest. However, anyone with strong football knowledge is welcome to submit audio clips for review, and we will discuss how to collaborate on a podcast.
