#The Female Football Fanatic
The Female Football Fanatic is a sports podcast site that focuses on college football with a side of the NFL, college basketball and the NBA from a female fan's perspective. There will be at least two new podcasts weekly--one breaking down Michigan football's previous game while previewing Michigan's next game, and another one discussing some of the previous weekend's biggest games and happenings in college football. There will also usually be at least one NFL-related podcast each week. This is a beta version of the site, built using JavaScript, jQuery and AJAX. 

##How To Launch the Project
To run the project, visit [this] (https://drsimonxx.github.io/fff/) link in your browser. The project works best with Chrome or Firefox, but it should be viewable and have full functionality in any other browser, including on mobile devices. 

##How To Use the Site
The site has navigation buttons within a light-blue audio player under the podcast descriptions--a previous button, play button and next button. Click the 'play' button to hear a podcast. Select the 'next' button to go to the next podcast. Underneath the buttons and the volume slider, there is a section displaying the title/topic of the next podcast that you will hear if you click the 'next' button. Click the 'previous' button (far left) to go back to a previous podcast. 

**Please note that podcasts do not immediately begin to play, even if the 'play' button indicates a podcast is playing. You must press the 'play' button to begin each podcast at this time. This will likely change in the near future in some form.**

In the audio player under the name and number of the current podcast, there is a slider that allows you to advance in the podcast or go back in the podcast. In other words, you can skip a topic, skip ahead to the end, go back to what you've already heard in a podcast, etc.

After about two weeks, each podcast will be moved to the 'Archives' section of the site and will still be stream-able in the archives.

##Known Issues
**Internet Explorer**--In IE, you might have to make changes to your browser's settings in order for the podcasts to play and for the sliders to work properly. Here are directions for how to fix these issues if you encounter them:

- Look for "tools" from the menu or the tools icon. Go [here] (https://www.google.com/search?q=internet+explorer+tools+icon&biw=1536&bih=781&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=0ahUKEwiOjrLy7q7PAhUCOiYKHc0ZBHUQ_AUIBigB) if you're unsure of what the tools icon looks like. 
- Scroll down to and accept "Internet Options."
- Click on the "Advanced" tab in the pop-out window.
- Scroll down a bit more than halfway until you get to "Multimedia."
- Check-mark the options regarding playing animations and playing sounds in webpages. You might also need to select "Show pictures," also, if it's not already selected.
- Refresh the page if necessary, and you should be set!
